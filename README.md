# WorkshopSelector
As with the Math Game code you will want to access the Form1.cs file to view all of the hard code that was done.
The user can view a reciept after they pick all of the options for their workshop. This code also executes a try catch to throw an error in case the user doesnt make a selection where it is needed.
